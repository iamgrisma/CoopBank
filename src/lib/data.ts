// Server-side data fetching functions that were previously here have been moved 
// directly into the Server Components (page.tsx files) that use them.
// This was done to resolve a build error caused by client components
// indirectly importing server-only modules ('next/headers').
// Keeping server and client code strictly separated is a best practice in Next.js.
